In order to have made this file, I went through the following steps. First I created a new git repository on GitHub. Then after troubleshooting a problem with my computer not accepting my GitHub account, I cloned the newly made repository off GitHub and unto my odin-project repository. From here using the TOUCH command I created this file, opened it, and here I am typing away.
